## 1st Semester
**Course:** Algorithms and Procedural Programming in C  
- Analysis and implementation of algorithms in the C programming language.  
- Data structures: arrays, sets, file handling.  

**Projects:**  
1. **BestTime2Party** – Calculate the optimal arrival time at an event for maximum interactions (algorithm in C using time interval analysis).  
2. **DoAIGotSkills** – Find the minimum set of candidates covering all required skills (Greedy algorithm in C, using sets and sorting).
